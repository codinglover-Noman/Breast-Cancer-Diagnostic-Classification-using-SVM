## Models Explored

1. K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) Algorithm
Description:
K-NN is a versatile classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.
Usage:
Explored for its potential in breast cancer diagnostic classification.
2. Support Vector Classifier
Description:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes.
Usage:
Applied to breast cancer diagnostic classification for comparison with other models.
3. Logistic Regression
Description:
Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification. It models the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular category.
Usage:
Investigated for its effectiveness in breast cancer diagnosis.
4. ExtraTree-decision
Description:
ExtraTree-decision is an ensemble learning method based on constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes.
Usage:
Explored as part of the ensemble models for diagnostic classification.
5. Random Forest
Description:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes.
Usage:
Utilized to harness the power of ensemble learning in breast cancer diagnosis.
6. Keras
Description:
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It enables fast experimentation with deep neural networks.
Usage:
Explored for its capabilities in the context of neural network-based diagnostic classification.
